    TypeScript
    - It is not reccomended to commit compiled JS files from TypeScript to git. It's reccomended that src files are only commited.
    "If you only use .ts files in your source directory, you can add /**/*.js to your .gitignore to prevent files from being added accidentally."
    I used /server in the gitignore to be safe
    "build artefacts and outputs shouldn't be added to your repository"

    Tailwind:
    - Setting custom font sizes for the app is something I like to do (now) so that I am not constantly guessing and checking the font of other text. I may use : "app-h1" "app-regular" "app-wide-h1" "app-wide-regular"

Today I am tacling authentication! I have decided to implement both local and google SSO, for ease of logging in, and practice!
- [] implement local authentication with jwts and cookies!
- [] implement google SSO!
I finished sign up function, am working on login route handler.

10/16
- [x] finish implementing local authentication with jwts and cookies!
Today I worked a lot on the authentication, and did research. I found that I had a hard time understanding everything and needing to travel down rabbitholes to understand. BUT with a lot of preserverence, resourcefulness, and not allowing myself to endlessly fall down these holes, I found that doing a lot of research like this is very benefitial, especially for my future self.
