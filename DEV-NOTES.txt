    TypeScript
    - It is not reccomended to commit compiled JS files from TypeScript to git. It's reccomended that src files are only commited.
    "If you only use .ts files in your source directory, you can add /**/*.js to your .gitignore to prevent files from being added accidentally."
    I used /server in the gitignore to be safe
    "build artefacts and outputs shouldn't be added to your repository"
